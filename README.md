# Game of Hanoi Towers with Auto-Solve and Step Counter

This is a digital version of the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The game features an automatic solver that allows users to visualize the optimal solution to the puzzle, showing each step required to move the disks between the towers. The application also includes a step counter to track the number of moves made during the manual play or the auto-solve process, helping users understand the efficiency of their solution.

### Rules:
1. **Objective**: Move all the disks from the original tower (source tower) to another tower (destination tower), using a third tower as an intermediary.
2. **Disk movement**: You can only move one disk at a time.
3. **Order**: You can only place a smaller disk on top of a larger one. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.
4. **Minimum moves**: The minimum number of moves required to solve the game is `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the number of disks.

### How to Play:
1. **Set up the game**: You start with three towers and a set of disks stacked in descending order on the source tower (the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top).
2. **Moving the disks**: The player moves one disk at a time from one tower to another, following the above rules. You can only use one hand (if physical) or click/drag (if digital).
3. **End of the game**: The game ends when all the disks are stacked on the destination tower in the same order (largest on the bottom, smallest on top).

The challenge is to solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible, or you can enjoy watching the auto-solve feature in digital versions of the game.
